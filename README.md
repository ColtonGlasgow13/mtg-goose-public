# Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous project collected limited amounts of data about collectible card prices, but I wanted a system that would provide all the data I could want in terms of investment and resale decisions. Therefore, I developed an application to scrape data from a variety of sources and store it in a remotely hosted relational database, where I then used it for analysis and visualization. Through the support of this application, I have been able to sustain my collectible resale business ([Household Gaming](https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/household_gaming)) for years by making data-driven decisions and building my understanding of the market from the bottom up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project took a very significant amount of time and effort to complete, as I had to work through some of the struggles of larger applications while exploring new environments and tools. Before this project I had never controlled a server, programmed in SQL, designed a database, scraped from javascript-based sites, or allowed a program to make investment decisions for me, so the process was eye-opening in many ways. But by the time it was complete, I had used all of these skills to develop a unique application, field-tested to have the ability to generate a stronger return on investment than I could have ever achieved manually.

# Groundwork

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to gather consistent data, collection needs to be automated, but running a script through the Windows Task Scheduler wasn't cutting it. It didn't run when my computer wasn't on, and even when it was it often didn't run consistently and took up too many system resources. In addition, given the amounts of data that I wanted to collect and use, a remote server was the best option to contain my project. However, I had no experience with this process and no server to use, so I would have to build it up from scratch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to claw through the process of setting up a remote server with the basics available to me ([this guide](https://data36.com/data-coding-101-install-python-sql-r-bash/) and others on data36 were a lifesaver, I highly recommend using it if you are trying a similar project), including a postgresql server and jupyter notebook, both of which I could access from my pc, making interaction more efficient. Now that I had a platform to work from, I could get started developing functionality.

# Database Structure

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first time working with a database, so I wasn't aware of many existing conventions for database organization. However, the schema that I developed was essentially in line with common data warehousing structures, so I ended up satisfied with its capabilities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A central, recurring issue concerning the development of applications that work with collectibles is that there is not a strong centralized resource for information about these collectibles. The stock market has SEC's EDGAR and the consistent reports of different exchanges, but for collectibles I had to rely on independently maintained sources such as [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/). MTGJSON was an essential resource for developing not only my application, but also a variety of well-known and widely used public applications such as [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), [Cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en), and [Cardsphere](https://www.cardsphere.com/). With it, I had access to detailed information about every Magic: the Gathering card in existance, all ready to download and use, which allowed my database to track every single card without the need to manually input their information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of my database provides a unique id for every card, but even using that, normalization of the incoming data was a substantial roadblock. There are many different variants and printings of cards with the same name, and every site that I needed data from uses different naming and labeling conventions, so I couldn't scrape information directly into tables. To get around this problem, I developed a standardization system which contained the alternate names for each card depending for every site being used, and referenced them whenever data was read in. Now that I had established storage for the data, I needed to collect it.

# Data Collection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is no centralized resource for collectible card data, so as I wanted to monitor many different sources I needed to scrape the data from each source individually. There are hundreds of companies that sell collectible cards, and even though the focus of the application is on Magic: the Gathering products, there are still too many to track. Therefore I chose some of the most crucial sources to work with under the following criteria. First, if I intended to sell cards using a platform, it would of course be essential to keep track of that platform's prices. In addition, I wanted to track a variety of buylists, because as described in my previous project, buylists represent a safe backbone for the price of cards. I chose some of the largest and most popular buylists, because they are the most likely to want to buy large quantities of cards and are the most dependable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some buylists, such as [Card Kingdom's Buylist](https://www.cardkingdom.com/purchasing/mtg_singles?filter[sort]=price_desc), are html-based, so I could scrape them via Python's built-in [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) package to pull the sites and the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) package to access the data more efficiently. I standardized all the cards and processed their information using a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) DataFrame, and employed [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) to send it to the table corresponding to the company's buylist data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other buylists, such as Miniature Market's (while it still existed), presented their buylist prices in the form of Javascript, so I couldn't scrape them as efficiently and directly. I was forced to use [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a WebDriver that allowed my program to appear as a person using a browser, which them allowed me access to pricing. This process was slower and harder to design, so it was only used when necessary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, thankfully [TCGPlayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) allowed me access to their internal price API for private use as a seller on their platform. TCGPlayer is one of the largest marketplaces for collectible cards and allows anyone to open a storefront, so scraping it would have been very slow and inefficient. Thanks to their API access, I could quickly acquire the data I needed for every card sold on this large platform, which is often treated as the "market price" for cards in the US.

# Data Application

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I was collecting data for each of these metrics daily, what could I do with it? Well, first of all, I could visualize any data that I wanted to observe trends or price history in an intuitive way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is useful, but a far more impactful application of the data was arbitrage. The collectible card market isn't unified at all, which means that while establishing a strong foundation of data is difficult, once you have that foundation you have information that the large companies in the market don't have. Retailers don't communicate, at least not nearly often enough, they prefer to look at their self-contained ecosystem if they want to determine their card prices, if they do any kind of analysis at all. Because of that, if one company is running low on a card and wants to buy it, they may post a price that is higher than the price another company is selling at, without ever realizing. This market is full of inefficiencies like that, which are completely unheard of in the stock market or other highly reactive and centralized markets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the most pressing use for this data was arbitrage, which are essentially opportunities to make risk-free money simply because of a lack of communication in the market. Once I could see every vendor's data, I actually knew more than even the largest companies did about other companies' needs in the market, and bridging those gaps provides returns that require no prediction or reasoning - after all, it isn't that hard to figure out "I'll buy 30 of these for $15 each from this company and ship them to another company for $16 each." The first place I looked to employ this strategy was a platform called [Cardsphere](https://www.cardsphere.com/).

# Cardsphere Arbitrage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardsphere is a platform for buying and selling cards, but it is unique in that the sales model is flipped. Rather than sellers posting their cards and prices, buyers post a list of cards they want and the prices they will pay, and sellers can then choose whether or not to sell at those prices. It's a bit like everyone gets to post their own buylist, which is something that is generally restricted to companies that have large customer bases. So naturally, now that I knew exactly what I could sell every card for, I could generate my "free money" buylist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the price data scraped daily from TCGPlayer and buylists, I could see what I could get immediately for every card from either the market or from retail companies, and could automate the creation of my own buylist based on that. I simply took the highest price for each card (with a simple risk-reducing algorithm to consider shipping time), subtracted an acceptable margin, and uploaded the massive list to Cardsphere daily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, these prices were typically lower than market, so people weren't willing to fill most of these buy requests. But out of 40,000+ cards, there were always bound to be outliers that a company was buying at a high price, or that were undervalued on Cardsphere, and those are the cards that people took my offers on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system worked! I was generating income by just patching holes in the market on this small selling platform - imagine the opportunity if applied to every company! I had been running my business for a while, but this was the first time that I was able to source inventory in a dependably profitable way. Of course there were limitations - due to the small customer base of the platform, I was only able to buy a few hundred dollars of inventory from it every week - there simply weren't enough people to buy more at sustainable prices. So even if it wouldn't carry my business, it was still proof of concept.

# The Future

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may seem strange to end the project here, because after all it isn't being worked on or used anymore. It had a lot of potential, and I was excited to put it to use, except for one issue - the Pokemon market was beginning to explode in a historic way. It was clear that the Pokemon Trading Card Game would be a far more profitable business platform, at least in the short term, so I pivoted into that market. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to continue applying this system to the Magic: the Gathering market, but it turned out to be a timely decision, as Pokemon products across the board skyrocketed for the next 5 months. The market boom was due to COVID supply restrictions, an increase in demand, and an overall market correction with plenty of inefficiency, so as someone with presence in the industry already, making large profit margins didn't require any data analysis at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, mtg-goose was pushed to the wayside in favor of easier money, eventually to be discontinued completely. The profitability of Pokemon is still higher than that of MTG at the time of writing (June 2021), but besides that, the success of Pokemon brought my attention to the issue of scaling. I couldn't continue to grow my business at the same rate while also maintaining my studies, so I had to abandon selling single cards. My business is still alive, focusing on sealed product because of its higher value density for storage space and simpler inventory tracking, and I am moving back into the data analysis world with my [current project](https://coltonglasgow13.github.io/goose-stock/), which focuses on stock prices.

# Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I didn't get to fully integrate it into a company, I learned so much throughout the process of this project and improved on many aspects of my development skills. I'm now comfortable creating, interacting with, and maintaining a remote database, and have hundreds of hours of experience processing and analyzing data in Python through the pandas package. I've used SQL enough that I would consider myself to be fluent, and I integrated my program with an API for the first time. I'm applying all of these skills and more to my next project analyzing stock data, so while it seems like a different field, for the first time I'm heading into a project with the feeling that I know what I'm doing. I'm confident that I'll be able to find trends and untapped potential in the stock market in the same way I did with collectible cards, by studying the data scientifically and thouroughly.
