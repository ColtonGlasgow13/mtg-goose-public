# Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous project collected limited amounts of data about collectible card prices, but I wanted a system that would provide all the data I could want in terms of investment and resale decisions. Therefore, I developed an application to scrape data from a variety of sources and store it in a remotely hosted relational database, where I then used it for analysis and visualization. Through the support of this application, I have been able to sustain my collectible resale business ([Household Gaming](https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/household_gaming)) for years by making data-driven decisions and building my understanding of the market from the bottom up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project took a very significant amount of time and effort to complete, as I had to work through some of the struggles of larger applications while exploring new environments and tools. Before this project I had never controlled a server, programmed in SQL, designed a database, scraped from javascript-based sites, or allowed a program to make investment decisions for me, so the process was eye-opening in many ways. But by the time it was complete, I had used all of these skills to develop a unique application, field-tested to have the ability to generate a stronger return on investment than I could have ever achieved manually.
